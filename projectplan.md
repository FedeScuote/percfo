# P&L Analyzer PoC - Implementation Plan

## Problem Analysis

Based on the PRD, we need to build a standalone web tool that:
- Accepts CSV uploads with P&L data
- Calculates financial metrics (Revenue, Gross Margin, Net Profit, etc.)
- Displays interactive charts and visualizations
- Generates AI-powered insights using OpenAI API
- Provides a demo-worthy, stateless experience

**Current State**: Empty project with only PRD documentation
**Goal**: Fully functional P&L analyzer with upload → analysis → insights flow

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation
- [ ] 1.1 Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- [ ] 1.2 Install and configure Tailwind CSS
- [ ] 1.3 Install chart library (Recharts)
- [ ] 1.4 Set up basic project structure and folders
- [ ] 1.5 Create basic layout component

### Phase 2: CSV Upload Interface
- [ ] 2.1 Create file upload component with drag & drop
- [ ] 2.2 Add CSV validation and parsing logic
- [ ] 2.3 Create preview component to show parsed data
- [ ] 2.4 Handle file upload errors gracefully

### Phase 3: Financial Calculations Engine
- [ ] 3.1 Create utility functions for financial metrics
- [ ] 3.2 Implement revenue, expenses, and profit calculations
- [ ] 3.3 Add margin calculations (Gross Margin %, Net Profit Margin %)
- [ ] 3.4 Create month-over-month growth rate calculations
- [ ] 3.5 Add expense spike and anomaly detection

### Phase 4: Dashboard & Visualizations
- [ ] 4.1 Create KPI cards component for key metrics
- [ ] 4.2 Build line chart for Revenue & Net Profit trends
- [ ] 4.3 Build bar chart for expense categories
- [ ] 4.4 Create responsive dashboard layout
- [ ] 4.5 Add basic filtering functionality

### Phase 5: AI Insights Integration
- [ ] 5.1 Set up OpenAI API integration
- [ ] 5.2 Create prompt engineering for financial insights
- [ ] 5.3 Build insights display component
- [ ] 5.4 Add loading states and error handling

### Phase 6: Polish & Demo Readiness
- [ ] 6.1 Add sample CSV file for demo purposes
- [ ] 6.2 Improve UI/UX and visual design
- [ ] 6.3 Add responsive design tweaks
- [ ] 6.4 Test end-to-end workflow
- [ ] 6.5 Performance optimization

## Technical Decisions

**Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router for modern React features
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid, utility-first styling
**Charts**: Recharts for React-native chart components
**File Handling**: Browser-native File API for CSV parsing
**AI**: OpenAI API for generating business insights
**State Management**: React useState/useEffect (no external state library needed)

## Expected CSV Format
```
Month,Revenue,COGS,Marketing,Operations,Other_Expenses
2024-01,100000,40000,15000,10000,5000
2024-02,120000,48000,18000,12000,6000
```

## Deployment Strategy
- Vercel deployment for seamless Next.js hosting
- Environment variables for OpenAI API key
- Static generation where possible for performance

## Success Metrics
- Upload to insights displayed in < 5 seconds
- Clean, professional demo-worthy interface
- Accurate financial calculations and meaningful AI insights
- Responsive design working on desktop and tablet
