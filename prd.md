Got it ‚úÖ Thanks for the clear answers. Here‚Äôs a lean PRD draft for your P&L Analyzer PoC:

‚∏ª

üìÑ PRD ‚Äì P&L Analyzer PoC

1. Objective

Build a standalone web tool where a user uploads a CSV with P&L data and instantly gets:
	‚Ä¢	Key financial metrics (Revenue, Gross Margin, Net Profit, Expenses breakdown).
	‚Ä¢	Charts for visualization.
	‚Ä¢	A few AI-generated insights (alerts/trends).

Optimized for demo wow factor with minimal tech overhead.

‚∏ª

2. Users
	‚Ä¢	Audience: Potential stakeholders (non-CFO but with basic finance understanding).
	‚Ä¢	Goal: Quickly understand the financial health of a business.
	‚Ä¢	No login required (stateless, frictionless).

‚∏ª

3. Input
	‚Ä¢	File: CSV (predefined format, e.g., Month, Revenue, COGS, Opex, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	User uploads their own file via drag & drop or file selector.

‚∏ª

4. Output

4.1 Metrics
	‚Ä¢	Topline: Revenue, Expenses, Net Profit.
	‚Ä¢	Margins: Gross Margin %, Net Profit Margin %.
	‚Ä¢	Trends: Month-over-month growth rates.
	‚Ä¢	Flags: Expenses spikes, negative profit, unusual ratios.

4.2 Visualizations
	‚Ä¢	Line chart: Revenue & Net Profit by month.
	‚Ä¢	Bar chart: Expense categories.
	‚Ä¢	KPI cards: Quick snapshot (Revenue, Profit, Margins).

4.3 AI Insights
	‚Ä¢	Short, plain-language observations like:
	‚Ä¢	‚Äú‚ö†Ô∏è Marketing spend increased 25% last month while revenue stayed flat.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚Äú‚úÖ Net margin is improving for 3 consecutive months.‚Äù

‚∏ª

5. Features
	‚Ä¢	Upload CSV ‚Üí immediate analysis.
	‚Ä¢	Display metrics, charts, and AI insights in a clean dashboard.
	‚Ä¢	Basic interactivity: filter by month or category.

‚∏ª

6. Tech Stack
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: Next.js (React, Tailwind for styling, Recharts or Chart.js for charts).
	‚Ä¢	Backend/API: Simple Next.js API route for parsing CSV & running analysis.
	‚Ä¢	AI: Call OpenAI API with summary of computed metrics to generate insights.
	‚Ä¢	State: Stateless (no DB, analysis done in-memory).

‚∏ª

7. Success Criteria

‚úÖ User uploads CSV ‚Üí sees metrics, charts, and insights within seconds.
‚úÖ No login, no setup.
‚úÖ Demo-worthy interface with clean visuals.

‚∏ª

8. Out of Scope (for PoC)
	‚Ä¢	Multi-user accounts.
	‚Ä¢	Database storage.
	‚Ä¢	Integration with accounting software.
	‚Ä¢	Advanced financial modeling.

‚∏ª

üëâ Next step: I can draft a mock UI flow (upload ‚Üí dashboard ‚Üí insights) so you have a visual reference before coding.

Do you want me to sketch the UI wireframe for the PoC?
